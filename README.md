# ODbgScript

> ODbgScript is a plugin for OllyDbg, which is, in our opinion, the best application-mode debugger out there. 
> One of the best features of this debugger is the plugin architecture which allows users to extend its functionality. 
> ODbgScript is a plugin meant to let you automate OllyDbg by writing scripts in an assembly-like language. 
> Many tasks involve a lot of repetitive work just to get to some point in the debugged application. 
> By using this plugin you can write a script once and for all.
